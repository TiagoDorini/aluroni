# About
This project was made during a React course for learning porpuses. It's only a Front End app that uses React with TypeScript following the React Function Component Syntax. To style this app, I used Sass to write the CSS and also used CSS modules with it.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
